# A Proof of Concept demonstrating the ability to drain KyberSwap Elastic pools

## Introduction

This repo contains the details of an exploit that drains 82.37% of the Elastic pool for wstETH-ETH on the Ethereum Mainnet at block height 17050000 (2023-Apr-15 04:13:47 AM +UTC). **This root cause of this exploit has now been fixed and a new audit has been conducted**.



The exploit is generalisable to any pool running on the old Elastic code in the [ks-elastic-sc-legacy](https://github.com/KyberNetwork/ks-elastic-sc-legacy) repo.

I submitted this Proof of Concept to Kyber Network on 17 April 2023. Kyber Network quickly disabled minting of new positions, and asked their LPs to withdraw their liquidity. After swiftly fixing the code and performing a fresh [audit with Chain Security](https://chainsecurity.com/security-audit/kyberswap-elastic/) Kyber Network re-launched the Elastic pools on 24 April 2023.

You can read more about the exploit in my blog post [Saving $100M at risk in KyberSwap Elastic](https://100proof.org/kyberswap-post-mortem.html).

## Details

1. The report for this exploit is in [REPORT.md](./REPORT.md)
2. The test file that performs the exploit is in [test/KyberswapLegacyTest.sol](./test/KyberswapLegacyTest.sol). The details are in function `performFullHack` at [KyberswapLegacyTest.sol:133-236](https://github.com/one-hundred-proof/kyberswap-exploit/blob/main/test/KyberswapLegacyTest.sol#L130-L241)
3. A PoC showing the that vulnerability is **not** present in the updated contracts is in [KyberswapTest.sol](./test/KyberswapTest.sol).


## Setup

### Environment Variables
